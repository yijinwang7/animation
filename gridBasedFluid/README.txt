For the animation video, I created a disaster movie. The initial scene is a rocket which is drawn in red. The blue dot below the rocket represents a new energy source obtained by scientists from the deep sea. It is considered to be the safest and most reliable energy source found so far, which can propel the rocket into space. There are also some blue dots on the rocket, which are cooling devices for the rocket, and their purpose is to prevent the rocket from overheating and causing an explosion. Everyone, including scientists, is looking forward to the successful launch of this new rocket.
But when the rocket was launched, an accident happened. The rocket exploded, and it shot up into the sky in a ball of fire that quickly engulfed everything. The astronauts on the rocket and the scientists on the ground all died in this accident.
The cooling devices and new energy sources on the rocket failed to prevent this tragedy from happening. Will the new technology and science benefit mankind or bring misfortune to mankind?
No one knows.
